For year the MNIST database was the gold standard for testing computer vision. However, as machine learning has improved, the utility of MNIST has decreased. Many algorithms can achieve 97% accuracy on the database and some have gotten up to 99.7%. In response, Zalando Research has created a next generation MNIST database which has the same structure as MNIST however instead of hand written numbers, the new database includes 70,000 pictures of clothing of ten different classes. This paper will introduce two methods of machine learning that were used to attempt to identify what type of clothing is represented in each picture.
